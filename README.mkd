* **DQL** - Data Query Language, or Data Query Language. These are query commands. DQL commands are: **SELECT** (is the query command);

* **DTL** - Data Transaction Language, or Data Transaction Language. They are commands for transaction control. DTL commands: **BEGIN TRANSACTION**, **COMMIT** AND **ROLLBACK**;
